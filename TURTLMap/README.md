# üê¢TURTLMap: Textureless Underwater Real-Time Localization and Mapping
### [Project Page](https://umfieldrobotics.github.io/TURTLMap/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01569) | [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jingyu-song-93763a132_i-am-happy-to-share-that-our-paper-activity-7227132379373473792-Ci1H?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

We propose the first real-time localization and dense mapping solution that is robust to low-texture underwater scenes. TURTLMap is designed to be low-cost for scalability and is capable of running onboard on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano in real-time. TURTLMap leverages [GTSAM](https://gtsam.org/) to develop a multi-modal robust odometry and [Voxblox](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox) to build a dense 3D map.
